							<h4>Business Intelligence</h4>
							Business Intelligence (BI) enables a company to gain insight into its critical operations through reporting applications and analysis tools. Well-designed BI applications can give anyone in your company the ability to make better decisions by quickly understanding the various “information assets” in your organisation and how these interact with each other. These assets can include customer databases, supply chain information, personnel data, manufacturing, product data, sales and marketing activity, as well as any other source of information critical to your operation. A robust BI application, which includes integration and data cleansing functions, can allow you to integrate these disparate data sources into a single coherent framework for real-time reporting and detailed analysis by anyone in your extended enterprise – customers, partners, employees, managers, and executives.<br>
