                            Mobile, Cloud and Social are converging and accelerating one another to give rise to what RyHiLL calls CONSTANT ACCESS paradigm consisting of<br>

                            1.Continuous Services :solutions will increasingly need to be cloud-based to ensure they are always available on-demand and can be consumed on demand.<br>

                            2.Connected Devices :proliferation of the number and types of devices that allows users to be continuously or intermittently connected to the internet and with one another.

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-8 ">
                            The adoption of this paradigm will be accelerated by the gradual blending of Consumer technologies into the Enterprise or consumerization of IT. This is giving rise to a new breed of software product companies while at the same time placing new demands on existing ISVs. ISVs will need to grapple with what solutions need to be moved to the cloud and how, allowing users access on multiple devices without compromising on user experience or security or continuity, build social aspects into the product/service architecture while incorporating new technologies. These products and services will need to be developed in an Agile mode to ensure that immediate customer feedback and requirements take precedence, to demonstrate constant improvement and retain flexibility in a fast changing world.<br><br>

                            To succeed in this new world, while meeting time to market goals, budget constraints and talent shortage, ISVs need a Product Engineering Services partner with singular focus, deep understanding of the shifting technologies and willingness to work as an invested partner.<br><br>

                            RyHiLL with a singular focus on Mobile, Cloud and Social technologies can help you build the products of the future. Unlike other service providers, unencumbered by past investments or legacy skills, RyHiLL is building a company that only focuses deep on a few emerging technologies and is making the investments in people and accelerators that will help you constantly innovate and succeed.

                                Organizations are looking for new ways to curtail testing costs while increasing testing scalability. This is especially true when companies can spend as much as 10% to 12%t of the annual IT budget fixing core application problems. We think differently about application testing—more innovatively and holistically. Instead of testing for quality at the end, we focus on it throughout the application development life cycle.<br/><br/>

                                To maximize our client's cost reductions, we combine this industrialized focus on quality with productivity improvements and flexible sourcing. Our testing professionals define themselves as stewards of end-to-end quality, delivering testing productivity at a cost-effective price. We demonstrate this commitment by conducting quality assurance activities in each phase of the application development life cycle—from plan, analyze and design to build, test and deploy.

                           We deliver cost reductions and scalability improvements—and go one step further. We work to improve testing productivity through automation and industrialization, while also emphasizing a holistic, end-to-end quality strategy to drive quality throughout the application development life cycle. Combined with our offshore testing services and flexible sourcing model, our approach can reduce the cost of poor quality to less than 5% of IT spends<br>
